//  IEEZ — shared cross-chain interface + L1 (EEZ) execution structs.
//
//  This file holds:
//    - `ProxyInfo` and the `IEEZ` interface: direction-neutral, shared by the L1
//      (`EEZ`) and L2 (`EEZL2`) managers and by `CrossChainProxy` / `Bridge`.
//    - The L1-canonical, directionally-named execution structs consumed by `EEZ.sol`:
//        * an `L2ToL1Call` is a cross-chain call executed on L1 (flat
//          `l2ToL1Calls[]` array, walked by the `_currentL2ToL1Call` cursor),
//        * an `ExpectedL1ToL2Call` is a reentrant L1→L2 call fired during execution
//          (the `expectedL1ToL2Calls[]` table, counted by `_lastL1ToL2CallConsumed`).
//
//  The mirror-image L2 structs live in `IEEZL2.sol` with self-relative names and a
//  deliberately leaner layout (no `StateDelta`, `destinationRollupId`, or
//  `ExpectedStateRootPerRollup`) — L2 never hashes a whole entry/lookup, so its
//  layout is free to diverge from L1's.
//
//  Casing: types/events/errors are PascalCase (`L2ToL1Call`, `L1ToL2CallConsumed`,
//  `UnconsumedL2ToL1Calls`); variables / struct fields / params are mixedCase with
//  the connector capitalized (`l2ToL1Calls`, `_currentL2ToL1Call`).

///        callCount + Σ expectedL1ToL2Calls[i].callCount == l2ToL1Calls.length
///      The on-chain `_currentL2ToL1Call` cursor advances monotonically over `l2ToL1Calls[]` —
///      there's only one cursor across the whole tree. When a top-level call triggers a

///        - call 0: top-level, no reentry.
///        - call 1: top-level, triggers a reentrant call → matched against `expectedL1ToL2Calls[0]`,
